# Dart - Data Types

<p>One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.</p>

<p> The Dart language supports the following types</p>
<ul>
    <li>Numbers</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>Maps</li>
</ul>

### Numbers

<p>Numbers in Dart are used to represent numeric literals. The Number Dart come in two flavours.</p>

<ul>
    </li> Integer − Integer values represent non-fractional values, i.e., numeric values without a decimal point. For example, the value "10" is an integer. Integer literals are represented using the int keyword.</li>
    <li> Double − Dart also supports fractional numeric values i.e. values with decimal points. The Double data type in Dart represents a 64-bit (double-precision) floating-point number. For example, the value "10.10". The keyword double is used to represent floating point literals.</li>
</ul>

------

### Strings

<p>Strings represent a sequence of characters. For instance, if you were to store some data like name, address etc. the string data type should be used. A Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units. Runes are used to represent a sequence of UTF-32 code units.</p>
<p>The keyword String is used to represent string literals. String values are embedded in either single or double quotes.</p>

------

### Boolean

<p>The Boolean data type represents Boolean values true and false. Dart uses the bool keyword to represent a Boolean value.</p>

------

### List and Map

<p> The data types list and map are used to represent a collection of objects. A List is an ordered group of objects. The List data type in Dart is synonymous to the concept of an array in other programming languages. The Map data type represents a set of values as key-value pairs. The dart: core library enables creation and manipulation of these collections through the predefined List and Map classes respectively.</p>

### The Dynamic Type

<p>Dart is an optionally typed language. If the type of a variable is not explicitly specified, the variable’s type is dynamic. The dynamic keyword can also be used as a type annotation explicitly.</p>
