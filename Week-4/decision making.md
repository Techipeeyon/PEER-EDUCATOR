### Conditional constructs in Dart:

#### 1. if statement

```
if statement
```
<p>
An if statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

#### 2. if.... else statement

```
if...else Statement
```
<p>An if can be followed by an optional else block. The else block will execute if the Boolean expression tested by the if block evaluates to false.</p>

#### 3. else…if Ladder

```
else...if Ladder
```
<p>The else…if ladder is useful to test multiple conditions. Following is the syntax of the same.</p>

#### 4. switch…case Statement

```
switch…case Statement
```

<p>The switch statement evaluates an expression, matches the expression’s value to a case clause and executes the statements associated with that case.</p>
